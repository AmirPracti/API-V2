# Authentication

## Authentication Options
```shell
# Basic authentication:
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -u YOUR_EMAIL:YOUR_TOKEN  \
    https://api.practitest.com/api/v2/projects.json
# IS THE SAME AS (as parameters):
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    https://api.practitest.com/api/v2/projects.json?developer_email=YOUR_EMAIL&api_token=YOUR_TOKEN
# IS THE SAME AS (via header):
    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "PTToken: YOUR_TOKEN" \
    https://api.practitest.com/api/v2/projects.json
```
> Make sure to replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your API token.

PractiTest uses API tokens for authentication. You can create a new API token by going to the Account Settings - "API Tokens", or going to your personal settings for Personal Tokens. Please visit <a href="https://www.practitest.com/help/account/account-api-tokens/" target="_blank">API tokens</a> for more information.
API expects the API-token to be included in all API requests to the server.
There are three ways to authenticate to PractiTest API V2 (you can choose anyone of the three):

* basic authentication - with curl commands it is  -u YOUR_EMAIL:YOUR_TOKEN (can be any:YOUR_TOKEN too)
<br>**OR**
* Parameters - parameters in the query string (which is usually more convinient with browser's debugging) - api_url?api_token=YOUR_TOKEN
<br>**OR**
* Custom Header - PTToken -  for example <br>
`export TOKEN='YOUR_TOKEN'`<br>
`curl -X POST -H "PTToken: $TOKEN" \`<br>
` -H "Content-Type:application/json" \`<br>
`-d '{"data": { "type": "requirements", "attributes": {"name": "one", "author-id": 6178, "priority": "highest"}  } }' \`<br>
`"https://api.practitest.com/api/v2/projects/4823/requirements.json"`<br>

You must replace <code>YOUR_TOKEN</code> with your custom API token.

**Developer email is not authenticated by the API, and not required anymore. You can put there anything (even the word 'any'). But if you have errors, or bad syntax, the only way that we get back to you, would be if you put your valid email address. This way we can help you if we see something wrong.

PractiTest supports two types of API Tokens:
### Account API Token
This is the most powerful API token type, with access to all projects in the account, and all the API resources described in this document.

### Personal Api Token - PAT
This token type was introduced in May 2020, and it is being gradually supported in all the API resources.

Currently NOT ALL THE RESOURCES are working with PAT, and for each resource there's a specific description specifically for this token type.

When working with the Personal API Token each user may have its own token; and then PractiTest will provide access to an API resources based on the userâ€™s permissions.

For example -> in the <a href="#projects">Projects API request</a>, with Account Token, you may list all projects in the account; PAT allows you to show only the projects in the account that the specific user has access to.

Please take into account, once again, that not all API resources currently support PAT, and so you should check this before working with the API and this token type
